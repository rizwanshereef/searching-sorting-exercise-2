# Sorting-Searching Exercises 03/09/2020

#### Problem 1
1)	Create function to accept the details of 10 products(product name- String)
2)	Create function to arrange the elements in descending order using insertion sort
3)	Create a function to find any one of the product in the given list and then display the product details to user - binary search

#### Problem 2
Given an integer array of which both first half and second half are sorted, merge two sorted halves of the array into a single sorted array.


#### Problem 3
Given a singly linked list and a key, find the key using the binary search approach.
		
#### Problem 4
Given an array of n distinct numbers, sort all even-placed numbers in increasing and odd-placed numbers in decreasing order. The modified array should contain all sorted even-placed numbers followed by reverse sorted odd-placed numbers.
Note: the first element is considered as even placed because of its index 0. 

#### Problem 5
Given an array of integers, segregate odd and even numbers in an array. 
Note: Order of elements can be changed.
*For ex: arr[] = {12, 17, 70, 15, 22, 65, 21, 90}
Array after separating odd and even numbers :
{12, 90, 70, 22, 15, 65, 21, 17}*


#### Problem 6
1) Create a function to accept the details of 5 Items in String.
2)  Create function to arrange the items in ascending order using bubble sort.
3) Create a function to add the sorted items to linked list. 
4) Create a function to  find any one of the items in the linked list and then display the item details to user - linear search
